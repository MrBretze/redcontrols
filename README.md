# redcontrols
A small redstone controls mod for Minecraft that adds a few redstone-based blocks. 


 Note that this mod does not include bundled cables of its own, but it is compatible with RedLogic, Project:Red, Bluepower, MineFactory Reloaded, and EnderIO cables. 

 

Switch Panel: block that lets you turn on and off each of the 16 signals in a bundled cable, like a panel of levers. 

Button Panel: block that lets you trigger any of the 16 signals in a bundled cable. They will turn themselves back off shortly afterward, like a panel of buttons.  

Indicator Panel: block that lets you check the state of all signals in a bundled cable, like a panel of redstone lamps. 

 

Analog Emitter: emits a selectable strength of redstone signal.  Use RMB and Shift+RMB to select. 

Toggle Switch: Acts like a lever, looks like a fancy button.  Inspired by the Switches mod. 

Redstone Power Wand: creates a short-lived air-like block wherever you click that emits a redstone signal.
