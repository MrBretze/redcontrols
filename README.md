# redcontrols
A small redstone controls mod for Minecraft that adds a few redstone-based blocks. 


 Note that this mod does not include bundled cables of its own, but it is compatible with RedLogic, Project:Red, Bluepower, MineFactory Reloaded, and EnderIO cables. 

 

Switch Panel: block that lets you turn on and off each of the 16 signals in a bundled cable, like a panel of levers. 

Button Panel: block that lets you trigger any of the 16 signals in a bundled cable. They will turn themselves back off shortly afterward, like a panel of buttons.  

Indicator Panel: block that lets you check the state of all signals in a bundled cable, like a panel of redstone lamps. 

Character Panel: block that uses a bundled cable signal to display a glowing Unicode character.  In its first mode, it uses all 16 bits to select the character and can be dyed.  In its second mode, it uses 12 bits to select the character and 4 bits to select the color.

Digital-Analog/Analog-Digital Converter: Converts 4 bits of a bundled redstone signal to or from an analog redstone signal strength.  RMB to change modes.  

Serializer/Deserializer: Experimental blocks for transmitting a bundled redstone signal over a single redstone line.  
 

Analog Emitter: emits a selectable strength of redstone signal.  Use RMB and Shift+RMB to select. 

Toggle Switch: Acts like a lever, looks like a fancy button.  Inspired by the Switches mod. 

Big Lever: A bigger lever that doesn't look like it was made of rocks and sticks

Breaker Switch: Yet another decorative alternative to levers

Covered Button: A button with a safety cover.  Shift+RMB to open or close the cover.  You can only press the button when it is open. 

Pressure Panels: Like pressure plates, but they can also be placed on walls and ceilings.  Available in all of the same types as pressure plates, as well as a new type that only players trigger

Redstone Power Wand: creates a short-lived air-like block wherever you click that emits a redstone signal.
